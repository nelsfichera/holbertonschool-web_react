## 2. Handling Events
### Create a new handing event
* In the Notifications component:
  * Convert the function into a React Class
  * Make sure that the tests are still passing
  * Create a new markAsRead function within the Notifications class. It accepts one argument: id(number)
  * When the function is called, it logs to the console the message â€œNotification $id has been marked as read
  * Pass the function markAsRead to the NotificationItem component as a property
* In the NotificationItem Class:
  * Modify the li element to call the new function markAsRead on click. It should send the id of the notification
  * Define the new property type and the default property for the new properties
  * Add the tests
* In the Notifications test file:
  * Create a test, that will mockup the console.log function
  * Check that when calling the function markAsRead on an instance of the component, the spy is being called with the right message
* In the NotificationItem test file:
  * Create a test, that will pass a spy as the markAsRead property
  * Check that when simulating a click on the component, the spy is called with the right ID argument
* Make sure to bind the function markAsRead in your constructor to avoid unecessary re-rendering
* In the test file, make sure to restore the console function you mocked
* At this point, reloading the App should display the exact same page as the last task. Use the React Chrome Extension to make sure the Notifications component displays correctly
* The console in your browser should not show any error or warning
